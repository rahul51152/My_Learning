volatile :----
	The volatile keyword is intended to prevent the compiler from applying any optimizations on objects that can change in ways that cannot be determined by the compiler.

	syntax : volatile int a;

restrict :----
	restrict keyword is mainly used in pointer declarations as a type qualifier for pointers.

	When we use restrict with a pointer ptr, it tells the compiler that ptr is the only way to access the object pointed by it, in other words, there’s no other pointer pointing to the same object i.e. restrict keyword specifies that a particular pointer argument does not alias any other and the compiler doesn’t need to add any additional checks.
