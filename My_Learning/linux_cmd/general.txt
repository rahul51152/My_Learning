if we are putting the command in terminal : wc -l file_name 
it gives number of the file.

	 : wc -L file_name(longest line charector)



four type of commands:
			1) executabale command
			2) shell builtins command
			3) shell scripts 
			4) alias
....>>>>> how to know about which type of command is thare ,
...........................> it is command for that : type command_name.

file path_of_command : it is give information about the executable command.

if we have to know about the path of the commnad : which commnad_name
if not shhow anything it is called shell buliting command.

whatis command : give sort iformation about the command.



we are use multiple command using ";"  and "&&",-->
examp : cd;cal;mkdir dir    (or)	cd && mkdir dir && cal



wildcard  : is a symbol that represents one or more charecters,
"*" :  it doing select all of the file ,
example : cp * dir1 :--> it doing all the file copying into the directory.
we can also use : rm * : delete  all the file.
we can use : cp file* dir1 : copy file which name is starting fromfile is coping in to directory.
we can use as : cp *.txt dir1.


this way one more symbole act like command : "?"
it is  represent a single charector,
command :  cp file?.txt dir1 :-> meas file1.txt, file2.txt.....represent only single charecter.
we can also use as : cp file??.txt dir1 :-> two charecter.

if we have large number of files, and we want to copy file which is starting from a,b and c, so we have command for that.
command : cp [abc]* dir1
		|     
	     file starting from a, b, c.

command for upper case and lower case :->
					cp [[:upper:]]* dir1
					cp [[:lower:]]* dir1
					cp [[:alpha:]]* dir1
					cp [[:alnum:]]* dir1
					cp [[:digit:]]* dir1


we can make our own command in the linux:
			-> using : alias command_name="discription"
						|         |
			 exmaple : alias     makedir : "mkdir dir1"

this make command store in the vim ~/.bashrc
